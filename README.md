# Data Entry Project by BojaroJujo
An example of a simple data entry form, created in Python, using the TKinter module. <br> The form acts as a way of entering educational-inspired data into a user friendly form, and saves it into an excel file.<br> Includes entry validation to ensure each field contains the correct information.<br><br>

This project used the following YouTube videos from Code First with Hala as a base for the design of the application, with extra features added by myself.<br>
